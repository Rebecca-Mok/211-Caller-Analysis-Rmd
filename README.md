# 211-Caller-Analysis
** This was a group project worked on with Cassandra Julienne Mojica and Pablo Jose Araujo Camacho **

The main question that is being addressed in this report is ***"How can service offerings in Toronto be improved?"***.

After analysing the 211 Caller Data, we determined that the main service gap was related to detoxification and this initiated our research. We gathered and analysed various different datasets from reliable data sources (Statistics Canada, Toronto Open Data Catalog, Ontario GeoHub) to find if there's any correlation between them. We focused our research on geographical locations of drug-related incidents, rates of drug related arrests/crimes, location of health centers, and the demographics and locations of the callers.

With this, we were able to develop data analysis plans and project report on the general trends and build visualizations (aesthetic maps, models, tables graphs) such that it's easier for readers to understand. We also made suggestions on service improvements based on our findings.
